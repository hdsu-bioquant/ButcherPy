Be aware, that the matrix should have the form (samples, genes), meaning that the genes are stored in the columns. Thus, make sure to provide a boolean value for gene_columns; True if the genes are stored in the columns and False if not.\n",

This is the best option, if the function fails with the provided data files to the gene and sample annotations.
